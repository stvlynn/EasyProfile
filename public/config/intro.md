I'm Steven Lynn, an AI developer and amateur landscape photographer. I'm passionate about building AI-powered tools and applications that make people's lives easier and more productive.

Currently, I'm focusing on:
- Building AI applications with modern web technologies
- Contributing to open source projects
- Exploring the intersection of AI and photography

I believe in the power of technology to solve real-world problems and create meaningful experiences. Through my work, I aim to bridge the gap between complex AI capabilities and user-friendly applications.

When I'm not coding, you can find me capturing the beauty of landscapes through my camera lens or experimenting with new AI models.
